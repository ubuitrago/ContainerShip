# ContainerShip
## AI-Powered Docker Optimization Platform

**Uriel Buitrago & Shane Aung**
Advanced Programming Tools - Summer 2025

---

### The Problem with Current Docker Optimization

• **Static analysis tools** lack contextual understanding
• **Commercial platforms** operate as "black boxes" with vendor lock-in  
• **Generic AI tools** don't understand containerization specifics
• **Developers struggle** with evolving best practices
• **Security vulnerabilities** often go undetected until runtime

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: Let's start by understanding the problem we're solving. Currently, Docker optimization relies heavily on static analysis tools like Hadolint that work with predefined rules. While these catch obvious mistakes, they lack contextual understanding of your specific technology stack. Commercial platforms like Snyk offer more features but operate as black boxes with expensive subscriptions and vendor lock-in. Even modern AI tools like GitHub Copilot, while powerful for general code completion, don't have the specialized containerization knowledge needed for effective Docker optimization. This leaves developers manually researching best practices and security updates, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
-->

---

### ContainerShip Solution Overview

• **Multi-LLM AI optimization** with support for OpenAI GPT & Google Gemini
• **Enhanced hybrid knowledge**: Local docs + DuckDuckGo + Tavily intelligence
• **Integrated vulnerability scanning** for Docker images and packages
• **Technology-aware analysis** tailored to your specific stack
• **Interactive web interface** with real-time analysis & security assessment
• **Extensible MCP architecture** for continuous improvement

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: ContainerShip addresses these limitations through a multi-faceted AI-powered approach that combines the best of both worlds. We now support multiple LLM providers - both OpenAI GPT and Google Gemini models - allowing users to optimize for cost, performance, or availability. Our enhanced hybrid architecture combines comprehensive local documentation with real-time web intelligence through both DuckDuckGo and Tavily APIs, ensuring recommendations are foundationally sound, current, and security-focused. The platform provides technology-aware analysis that understands your specific stack and includes integrated vulnerability scanning for Docker images and packages. All of this is delivered through an intuitive web interface that provides real-time analysis, security assessment, and feedback.
-->

### System Architecture

![ContainerShip Architecture](./architecture-diagram.png)

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: Let me walk you through our three-tier architecture with the latest enhancements. The frontend is a React TypeScript single-page application featuring an advanced Dockerfile editor with syntax highlighting, real-time analysis capabilities, and dedicated vulnerability scanning interface. The FastAPI backend serves as our orchestration layer and houses our MCP client, which manages all communication with our AI engine and coordinates multi-LLM support. The AI engine is built as an MCP server that coordinates multiple specialized tools for different aspects of Docker optimization. Our enhanced knowledge system draws from three sources: ChromaDB provides comprehensive local Docker documentation through a RAG system, DuckDuckGo offers privacy-focused web search, and Tavily delivers premium security intelligence. All of this intelligence is processed through either GPT-4o-mini or Google Gemini models, which we've optimized for containerization analysis through sophisticated prompt engineering.
